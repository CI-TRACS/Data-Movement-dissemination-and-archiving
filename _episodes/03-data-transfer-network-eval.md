title: "Data Transfer Evaluation Of The Network"
teaching: 10
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What are some tools we can use to test network throughput?"
objectives:
- "Learn about some of the tools for testing network performance."
keypoints:
- "Many times data transfer is impacted by factors other than the networks, but it helps to know how to test the network."

# Network (Only) Evaluation

# Throughput testing

> ##  Iperf3 (as distinct from "iperf" which is v2 or less)
> 
>  * [https://software.es.net/iperf/](https://software.es.net/iperf/)
>  * [https://github.com/esnet/iperf](https://github.com/esnet/iperf)
>  * Pre-compiled binaries for (everything)
>    * [https://iperf.fr/iperf-download.php](https://iperf.fr/iperf-download.php)
{: .callout}

> ## nuttcp
> 
>  * [http://nuttcp.org/]([http://nuttcp.org/)
>  * Much overlap with iperf3
>  * Allows "3rd party" operation where one machine can initiate tests between 2 other machines

# perfSONAR test nodes

> ## Provides test endpoints
> 
>  * iperf3
>  * owping/ping
>  * traceroute/tracepath
{: .callout}

* Academic and research centric
* Many servers around the world
* Multiple servers within UH Net
* You can install the clients on Linux laptop
  * Which allows you to control remote servers
* perfSONAR toolkit is available as a Docker Container\, which will work on Linux\-based Docker engines\. Getting the networking side working on MacOS or Windows \(or WSL\) is complicated\, if at all possible

# perfSONAR installation options

# LibreSpeedTest

* [https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest)
* Take this code and drop it into a directory on any web server
* It will provide a browser-based throughput estimate for a path

>
>* I have one in my house
>* UH has one on Manoa Campus

# LibreSpeedTest On A Home Network

# Ookla Speedtest (speedtest.net)

* Allows you to test to many points around the world from a web browser\.
  * [https://www.speedtest.net/](https://www.speedtest.net/)
  * Allow page to load and choose: "Change Server"
* Also offers a command line version
  * [https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli)
    * Which could be used to test from a remote machine via a terminal interface
>
>* Important to recognize that it focuses on testing your tester's Internet connectivity, possibly from multiple server locations
>* Distinct from testing between your location and a specific location
>* There are Ookla Speedtest servers at some universities, and if you test from a U. Hawaii campus to those servers, they should use REN paths
>* Typically, an ISP hosted server will use commodity paths
